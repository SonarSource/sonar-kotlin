<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Nested control flow statements <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>when</code>, and <code>try</code> are often key
ingredients in creating what’s known as "Spaghetti code". This code smell can make your program difficult to understand and maintain.</p>
<p>When numerous control structures are placed inside one another, the code becomes a tangled, complex web. This significantly reduces the code’s
readability and maintainability, and it also complicates the testing process.</p>
