<p>Mobile OSes use software keyboards that provide text predictions and suggestions. These keyboards cache text inputs in a local file in order to
speed up typing and to recall frequent phrases. When users type sensitive data into a text field where keyboard cache is enabled, the data will be
stored in clear-text in a local file. It will keep appearing in the keyboard suggestion list until the cache is cleared.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Keyboard caches are not designed to store sensitive information. Data they contain is not encrypted and can be exposed. In case a backup is
performed, the cache file can be included in the backup, which will lead to the password being leakage. When device is shared, other user will see the
password in the suggestion list.</p>

<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
TextField(
    value = text,
    onValueChange = { text = it },
    label = { Text("Password") },
    visualTransformation = PasswordVisualTransformation(),
    keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(keyboardType = KeyboardType.Text) // Noncompliant: keyboard cache is enabled
)
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
TextField(
    value = text,
    onValueChange = { text = it },
    label = { Text("Password") },
    visualTransformation = PasswordVisualTransformation(),
    keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(keyboardType = KeyboardType.Password)
)
</pre>
