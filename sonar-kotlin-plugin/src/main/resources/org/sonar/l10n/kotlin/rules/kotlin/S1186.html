<p>There are several reasons for a function not to have a function body:</p>
<ul>
  <li> It is an unintentional omission, and should be fixed to prevent an unexpected behavior in production. </li>
  <li> It is not yet, or never will be, supported. In this case an exception should be thrown. </li>
  <li> The function is an intentionally-blank override. In this case a nested comment should explain the reason for the blank override. </li>
</ul>
