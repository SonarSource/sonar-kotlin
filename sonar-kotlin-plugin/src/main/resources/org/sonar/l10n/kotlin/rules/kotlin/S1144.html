<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p><code>private</code> methods that are never executed are dead code: unnecessary, inoperative code that should be removed. Cleaning out dead code
decreases the size of the maintained codebase, making it easier to understand the program and preventing bugs from being introduced.</p>
