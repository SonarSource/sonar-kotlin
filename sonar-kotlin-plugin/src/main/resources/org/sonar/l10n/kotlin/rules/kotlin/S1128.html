<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The imports part of a file should be handled by the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), not manually by the developer.</p>
<p>Unused and useless imports should not occur if that is the case.</p>
<p>Leaving them in reduces the codeâ€™s readability, since their presence can be confusing.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
package my.company

import kotlin.String            // Noncompliant; "kotlin" classes are always implicitly imported
import my.company.SomeClass     // Noncompliant; same-package files are always implicitly imported
import java.io.File             // Noncompliant; "File" is not used

import my.company2.SomeType

class ExampleClass {

  val someString = ""
  val something = SomeType()

}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
package my.company

import java.io.File
import my.company2.SomeType

class ExampleClass {

  val someString = ""
  val something = SomeType()
  lateinit var fileUsage: File

}
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>Imports for types mentioned in KDoc comments are ignored.</p>
