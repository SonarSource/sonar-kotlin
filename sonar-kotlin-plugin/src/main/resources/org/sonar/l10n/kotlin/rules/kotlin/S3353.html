<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>If a local variable is never reassigned, it should be declared <code>val</code> to make it a constant within its scope. This makes the code easier
to read and protects the variable from accidental re-assignments in future code changes.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<h4>Readability and Understanding</h4>
<p>If a variable is declared <code>val</code>, it is evident to readers that the variable value is never altered but serves as a constant. This makes
it easier to understand the code because readers do not need to keep track of possible state changes of the variable.</p>
<h4>Wrong code</h4>
<p>Developers might intend for a variable to remain unchanged and have their code relying on that constraint. For example, a variable could be
expected to have a specific range. Changing the value of the variable could break that constraint. Also, developers could have assigned the wrong
variable. If the developers inject a value into a variable with an annotation, they should declare it as late initialized.</p>
<p>Declare variables that remain unchanged as <code>val</code> to avoid these mistakes.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Replace the keyword <code>var</code> with <code>val</code>.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
fun resize(): Int {
    var newLength = max(16, 2*bufferLength) // Noncompliant, `newLength` is assigned only once
    allocBuffer(newLength)
    return resize
}

class MyClass {
    @inject
    private var myVar: Int = 0 // Noncompliant, `myVar` is late initialized and should be declared as such
}
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
fun resize(): Int {
    val newLength = max(16, 2*bufferLength) // Compliant
    allocBuffer(newLength)
    return resize
}

class MyClass {
    @inject
    private lateinit var myVar: Int // Compliant
}
</pre>
