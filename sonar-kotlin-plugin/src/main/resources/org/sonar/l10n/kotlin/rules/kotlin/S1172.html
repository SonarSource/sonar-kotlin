<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A typical code smell known as unused function parameters refers to parameters declared in a function but not used anywhere within the function’s
body. While this might seem harmless at first glance, it can lead to confusion and potential errors in your code. Disregarding the values passed to
such parameters, the function’s behavior will be the same, but the programmer’s intention won’t be clearly expressed anymore. Therefore, removing
function parameters that are not being utilized is considered best practice.</p>
