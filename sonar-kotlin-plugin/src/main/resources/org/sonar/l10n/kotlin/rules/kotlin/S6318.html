<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The <code>suspend</code> function modifier is used to mark a function which might take some time to execute and could suspend the caller coroutine.
The location where such function is called is a "suspension point". Functions marked as <code>suspend</code> ("suspending functions") should
themselves contain at least one suspension point, otherwise it makes no sense to mark it as <code>suspend</code></p>
<p>This rule reports an issue if a function with <code>suspend</code> modifier has no calls to other <code>suspend</code> functions inside its
body.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
suspend fun function() { // Noncompliant, redundant 'suspend' modifier
    println("Hello!")
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
fun function() {
    println("Hello!")
}
</pre>
