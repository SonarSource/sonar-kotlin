<p>Obfuscation makes reverse engineering significantly more difficult by making code harder to understand. This helps to deter malicious actors from
easily discovering vulnerabilities or stealing proprietary algorithms in publicly deployed software. It is therefore recommended to enable obfuscation
in release builds.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>When you build a release version of your application, you’re creating a distributable package of your code. Without obfuscation, the compiled code
retains readable names and structures, making it much easier for someone to reverse-engineer your application. This means they can potentially
understand your code’s logic, extract sensitive information like API keys, or even modify your application for malicious purposes. Obfuscation
scrambles these names and structures, making it significantly harder to reverse-engineer and understand, thus protecting your intellectual property
and sensitive data.</p>
<p>Release builds are meant for distribution to end users and is therefore under constant scrutiny. Skipping obfuscation in these builds creates a
serious vulnerability. While debugging builds often disable obfuscation for easier troubleshooting, failing to enable it for release builds exposes
your application to unnecessary risks.</p>
<h2>How to fix it in Android</h2>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<p>By default, obfuscation is not enabled for the release build type.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
android {
    buildTypes {
        release {}
    }
}
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<p>Obfuscation can be enabled by setting <code>minifyEnabled</code> to <code>true</code>. The <code>proguardFiles</code> function then specifies the
ProGuard configuration files that will be used.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
android {
    buildTypes {
        release {
            isMinifyEnabled = true
            proguardFiles(
                getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android-optimize.txt"),
                "proguard-rules.pro"
            )
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>Setting <code>isMinifyEnabled</code> to <code>true</code> and providing <code>proguardFiles</code> in your Android Gradle configuration activates
code shrinking and obfuscation. R8 (or ProGuard in older projects) then analyzes your code, removing unused parts and renaming classes and methods to
obscure their purpose. This process makes it significantly harder for someone to reverse-engineer your application.</p>
<p>The <code>proguardFiles</code> let you define exceptions for code that shouldn’t be altered, ensuring that essential parts of your application
remain functional while still benefiting from the security enhancements of R8/ProGuard.</p>
