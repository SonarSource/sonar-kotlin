<p>This rule raises an issue when the code cognitive complexity of a function is above a certain threshold.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Cognitive Complexity is a measure of how hard it is to understand the control flow of a unit of code. Code with high cognitive complexity is hard
to read, understand, test, and modify.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, high cognitive complexity is a sign that the code should be refactored into smaller, easier-to-manage pieces.</p>
<h3>Which syntax in code does impact cognitive complexity score?</h3>
<p>Here are the core concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Cognitive complexity is incremented each time the code breaks the normal linear reading flow.</strong><br> This concerns, for example:
  Loop structures, Conditionals, Catches, Switches, Jumps to label and mixed operators in condition. </li>
  <li> <strong>Each nesting level adds a malus to the breaking call.</strong><br> During code reading, the deeper you go through nested layers, the
  harder it becomes to keep the context in mind. </li>
  <li> <strong>Method calls are free</strong><br> A well-picked method name is a summary of multiple lines of code. A reader can first explore a
  high-level view of what the code is performing then go deeper and deeper by looking at called functions content.<br> <em>Note:</em> This does not
  apply to recursive calls, those will increment cognitive score. </li>
</ul>
<p>The method of computation is fully detailed in the pdf linked in the resources.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Developers spend more time reading and understanding code than writing it. High cognitive complexity slows down changes and increases the cost of
maintenance.</p>
